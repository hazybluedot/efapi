## Summary

- Practice with comments
- Practice with user input
- Practice with formatted output
- Practice with elementwise vector arithmetic

## Graded Items

- [Dropbox: MATLAB Fundamentals Practice]({{wwwroot}}/sys.php?f=dropbox/main&pid=Lab08)
  - Upload your `lab08_[netid].m` file containing the final version of the Newton's Solver program.
  - We will be grading for
    - Use of comments - is each new calculation commented, and do they
      help understand the code *in the context* of the problem being
      solved?
	- Input prompts - do they make sense in the context of the problem the program solves?
	- Output formatting - does the message make sense in the context of the problem the program solves?

### Extra Credit

- [Quiz: Newton's Sled Challenge]({{wwwroot}}/sys.php?f=assess/main&name=quiz08_extra)
  - Like other quiz submissions of MATLAB code, you will just copy and
    paste the lines after all input variables have been assigned.
