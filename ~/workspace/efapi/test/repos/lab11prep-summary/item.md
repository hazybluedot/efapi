In this prelab we reviewed the concepts of

a model
: a mathmatical function describing the relationship between different
  data. As an example we used the spring model

  $$F = k\cdot{x}$$

  which describes the relationship between the force exerted ($F$) by
  a spring that is compressed or expanded by some amount $x$ from its
  resting state. The model parameter $k$ characterizes this linear relationship.



fitting data to a model
: given some experimental data and a general
  structure for a model, we want to find model parameters that best
  "fit" the experimental data


Importantly, we also looked at the meaning of model parameters in the
context of the model and data. In the example we saw how the model
parameter $k$ is the slope of the line and and estimate of the spring
constant for the spring used to generate the experimental data.
