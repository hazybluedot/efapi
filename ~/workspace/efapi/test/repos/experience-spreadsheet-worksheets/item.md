Worksheets can be used to organize your data and analysis. You may
want to create separate worksheets for different types of analysis, or
put your raw data on one worksheet while you perform analysis on
another. We will use worksheets to separate different practice
problems in the same file.

<!-- NOTES:
In the `lab03_practice` file that students will create in the next section they will be asked to create a number of worksheets with different names. Mention that when you demo this both so they can see it, and as a reminder that they can come back to this section when working if they don't catch it the first time.
-->

## Example

In the exercise start file, the worksheet labeled "EXAMPLE 1" is no longer needed. Right click the worksheet name and select "delete";

Create a new worksheet by clicking the `+` button near the worksheet tabs. On the new worksheet tab, right click and select "Rename Sheet". Name the new sheet "EXAMPLE 5".
