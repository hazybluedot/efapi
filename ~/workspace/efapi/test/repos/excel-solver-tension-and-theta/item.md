Go to worksheet "Exercise 1". Consider the homework problem
to the right. A helpful EF student posted the correct equations on the
EF151 discussion board:

$$\begin{array}{c}
T\cos(180-17) + T\cos(180-17-\theta) + 65\cos(360-38) &= 0\\ 
T\sin(180-17) + T\sin(180-17-\theta) + 65\sin(360-38) &= 0
\end{array}$$

Use the solver to find T and Î¸. Be careful not to use the name 'theta' since it is used in another sheet. Don't forget to use the `RADIANS` function.

Try it on your own first, but if you get stuck, check your formulas here:\

Answers should be <samp>$\theta=42^{\circ}$</samp> and <samp>T=34.8 lb</samp> <!-- {.result} -->
