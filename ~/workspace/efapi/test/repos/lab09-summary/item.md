# Summary

- Use subplots when plotting different kinds of data (different units)
  with a shared axis, such as time.
- Plot multiple data series on the same plot when all data series are
  of the same type (same units) and there is a reason to view the
  relationship between the data-series.

# Graded Items

- @[link](quiz/quiz09mc)
- @[link](dropbox/Lab09).

  Submit 1 file to your individual dropbox:
  1. Your lab09_{{netid}}.m script. Your program should
	 - Contain a documentation comment as the first few lines that describe the purpose of the program.
	 - Load the data as demonstrated
	 - Use indexing to assign individual data columns to variable names
	 - Generate a appropriately annotated position, velocity, acceleration plot assigning the figure handle to a variable named `fig_pva`
	 - Generate a appropriately annotated plot with the three forms of energy plotted assigning the figure handle to a variable named `fig_energy`
	 - Use comments to explain the data and clearly indicate each section of code that is producing a separate plot, i.e. the subplot section and the multiple data-series section.
<!--
2. The file you fixed for your neighbor with your own comments in the code.
     - The code should be fixed so that it runs and produces the expected results
	 - The code should be clearly annotated with comments to describe what was broken, why it was broken, and how you fixed it.-->
