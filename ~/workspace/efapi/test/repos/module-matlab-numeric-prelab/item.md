Review the [background and
motivation]({{wwwroot}}/modules/excel-numerical/#module-spreadsheet-numeric-calc)
for numerical techniques from Lab 5. We will be practicing the same
techniques and same mathematical concepts in MATLAB.

We will find that it is quite a bit simpler to calculate numerical
derivatives and integrals in MATLAB than in Excel, in part because
MATLAB is designed to be a tool to help solve engineering problems,
while Excel is designed to be a spreadsheet tool with a target
audience of business professionals.
