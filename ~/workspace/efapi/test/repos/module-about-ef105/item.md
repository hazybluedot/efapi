## Course Information

Syllabus
: Check the syllabus for course information including grading scale.

Calendar
: Check the calendar for important dates and deadlines. Note how the limitations of having a single due date for both Tuesday and Thursday sections may make staying up-to-date challenging.

Procedures
: Learn what to do if you will miss, or have missed a lab, for re-grade requests, and other tasks.

Discussion Board
: Ask questions as specifically as possible; Someone else may be having the same problem.<br>
  Please do **not** post Excel equations, Matlab code, or other forms of full solutions on the discussion board!
  You may either post your work in the Notes/Calcs box (don't forget to "save") directly on the quiz page, OR you may upload your file to the dropbox.

Help Sessions
: Help sessions will be offered every Wednesday from 4:00-6:00 PM. The first help session will be will be announced here when it is scheduled. It is *your* responsibility to attend these sessions if you are behind or making up a missed lab.

## Explore With a Neighbor

- Take a few minutes to explore the website with a neighbor, make note
  of where information such as late work and missed lab policies are
  so you know where to refer to if you find yourself in a relevant
  situation later.
- If something about a policy or expectation is unclear, discuss it
  with your neighbor. If you cannot reach a consensus, make a note of
  the question and ask it at the end of this activity.

## Graded Items

Quizzes
: - There will be 1-2 quizzes at the end of each lab. Some labs will have both a numerical quiz and a multiple choice quiz.</li>
  - You are **not** required to memorize anything for these quizzes! You **are** allowed to go back and look at the labs.
  - You do **not** have to finish the quiz in class! You will have **at least a week** to finish every quiz.
  - Some quizzes will require more work than others. They will never be *exactly* like problems worked in the lab, but they should be close enough for you to be able to figure out.
  
Dropbox Files
: You can upload files directly to the website. Some labs will require a file upload, to be graded by the TAs.
  <small>**Note:** Dr. Maczka and TAs have access to all files in the dropbox. If you get stuck on an assignment, upload your file to better enable us to help you.</small>
                
Other Graded Items
: - Attendance will be taken for every lab and is a small part of your grade. It is *your* responsibility to make up the work if you are absent.
  - Refer to the "Missed Lab" procedure to learn how participation credit may be earned when you are unable to be in class.
  - Feedback forms are also a small part of your grade. We do read them, and it's an easy 100 if you do them.
  - [Word and PowerPoint Self Paced lab](/ef105/modules/Word-and-Powerpoint) - this is required
  - [Spatial Visualization Test and Practice](/ef105/PSVT) - optional extra credit
  


## Computer and Software Requirements

If you use lab computers to access software for this course you will automatically be using the same version we are.

If may also choose to use your own computer for some or all of the course work. In this case, it is your responsibility to install up-to-date versions of the software tools we use, and make any adjustments to instructions if you are using versions different from those we use to demonstrate in class.
  - The minimum version of Microsoft Excel to be used in this class is the 2019 version. If you are a student whose primary affiliation is "student", you can <a href="https://oit.utk.edu/hardware-software/Pages/Student-Advantage.aspx" target="blank">download Microsoft Office Pro Plus at no cost.</a> This will allow you to have at least Excel 2019 on your computer.
  - Regarding MATLAB, you have two options:
    - You can <a href="https://webapps.utk.edu/oit/softwaredistribution/" target="blank">download it for free at the OIT software distribution page</a>, and have it installed in your computer, or</li>
    - You can <a href="https://apps.utk.edu/vpn/index.html" target="blank">run it remotely from the UTK citrix server.</a>

  <!-- <li><b>Students attending Laptop Sections:</b> make sure that your computer complies with the <a href="http://www.engr.utk.edu/futurestudents/computers.html" target="blank">minimum laptop requirements established by the UT College of Engineering.</a></li>
                             <li><b>A note for Mac users:</b> MATLAB R2016a version only supports MacOS 10.10 and above; MATLAB R2015a version only supports MacOS 10.9 and above. If you are not up to date on the operative system, you may need to either update the OS or install MATLAB R2014b.</li>
