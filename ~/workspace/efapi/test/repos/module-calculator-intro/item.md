# Introduction

![](pix/calc-small.png) The purpose of this lab is to introduce you to
a several different features of your calculator. These features
were selected based upon our observations on how students do and don't
use their calculator to its full advantage.  You are **not** expected
to memorize everything. You **are** expected to work through most of
the lab topics and be comfortable using these techniques with this
guide as a reference. 

After completing this lab you will have gained experience in the following areas:

- Storing intermediate results as variables for later use
- Using the solver feature to solve an arbitrary equation with a single unknown variable
- Using the matrix feature to solve a system of linear equations

## Calculator Selection

For simplicity, we will demonstrate skills using the TI-83+
emulator. If you have a different calculator module, refer to the
manual.

Were possible, we try to provide instructions for the TI84 and
TI-Nspire as well, but please be aware the instructions for these
calculators are less well-tested than for the TI83. Select your
calculator model below to display instructions specific to it when
available.
