In this lab we practiced these new skills and concepts:

- fitting experimental data to a polynomial model using [polyfit]
- inspecting the results of polyfit to report meaningful model parameters
- evaluating a polynomial along a set of x values using [polyval]
- visualizing a best fit model and experimental data on the same plot

We also gained more practice with these skills:

- indexing into a matrix to extract rows and columns
- indexing into a vector to extract different elements
- plotting multiple data series on the same plot
- controlling plot style
- printing formatted output with `fprintf`
- initializing a vector

  - Upload your completed "lab11_{{netid}}.m" file.
  - For full credit, your program should:
    - Run without errors
    - Print formatted output reporting model parameters for Model 1 and 2
    - Generate an appropriately annotated plot showing the measured position data as points, and Model 1 and Model 2 as lines.
