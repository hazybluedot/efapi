## Pre-lab Content

The structure of this and all future labs will assume that you
have spend 40-60 minutes familiarizing yourself with the
respective [pre-lab](./prelab.php) content *before* coming to
lab. Use this pre-lab time to think about any questions you
have and bring them up early during lab.

There will also be graded pre-lab quizzes that are due
*before* coming to lab.

Pre-lab quizzes will be available for 100% credit until the end of the
day on the last day of a lab (Tuesdays). After the 100% cutoff they
will immediately drop to 50% credit through the remainder of the
semester. This is different from regular quizzes!

## Exam 1 Grade

Exam 1 grades have been posted. You will see a grade item for the complete exam1 which is a weighted sum of the three components:
- Multiple Choice quiz (30%)
- Numerical quiz (35%)
- Spreadsheet file (35%)
	
Refer to the [course procedures]({{wwwroot}}/gen/procedures.php) for any grading concerns.

## Getting Started

The design of this lab activity assumes you have familiarized yourself with the pre-lab content associated with

- [Commenting Fundamentals]({{wwwroot}}/modules/matlab-matrices/prelab.php#module-matlab-commenting-fundamentals)
- [User Interaction]({{wwwroot}}/modules/matlab-matrices/prelab.php#module-matlab-user-io)
- [Working with Matrices]({{wwwroot}}/modules/matlab-matrices/prelab.php#module-matlab-matrices-prelab)

Complete the [pre-lab
quiz]({{wwwroot}}/sys.php?f=assess/main&name=prelab08_matrices) to
test your understanding. Ask questions about parts of the content that
you are unsure of.

Download the following files and move them to your "Lab08" folder.
- [lab08_start.m](./lab08_start.m). Download this file, rename it to `lab08_[netid].m`, replaceing `[netid]` with your NetID, and move it to your "EF105/Lab08" folder. You will complete the practice problems in this file and upload it to dropbox when complete. Notice the slight change in naming convention compared to last time. A file named `lab08_quiz_[netid].m` is referenced in the quiz for today's lab which is different from `lab08_[netid].m`.
