## Welcome to MATLAB

The name "MATLAB" is named for "MATrix LABoratory". This name hints at
one of its original design goals to provide a platform to work with
linear algebra (a subset of mathematics that works with matrices and
vectors) problems. While it has the flexibility to be used as a
general purpose programming environment, this is not what it was
designed for. You would typically **not** look to MATLAB to program a
graphical computer game, but it would be well suited for programming a
simulation of a robotic system.

## Tasks

Identify the following parts of the user interface

<div class="col-md-6">

<object class="svg-highlight" id="solver-overview" type="image/svg+xml" data="pix/MATLAB_default_layout_anno.svg"
	data-attribute-selector="#matlab-ide-annotations">
	<img src="pix/MATLAB_default_layout.png" />
</object>

</div>

<div class="col-md-6">

Current Path <!-- {#path-current} -->

: This shows the file path to the current folder. This should be the
  folder you have created for the current lab, such as `Lab07`.

Current Folder <!-- {#folder-current} -->

: This window shows the contents of the current folder. You can
  perform simple file management tasks in this window, such as
  renaming files, opening files to view in MATLAB, and moving files to
  sub-folders.

Editor <!-- {#editor-window} -->

: The editor window may not appear when you first start MATLAB. It
  appears automatically when you open a script file. As the name
  implies, this provides an interface to edit a file, most of the time
  we will be using the editor to edit script files ("m-files").

Command Window <!-- {#command-window} -->

: The command window provides an interface to type expressions and
  statements and have MATLAB evaluate them immediately. It can be used
  as a calculator, a place to experiment with and learn about new
  functions, and it will be the primary way we will interact with
  programs we write through input prompts and output messages.

Workspace <!-- {#workspace} -->

: The workspace displays the currently assigned variables along with
  their value and information about their structure. This provides one
  way to understand what the commands you executing are doing, and can
  be helpful when debugging a more complex program.
