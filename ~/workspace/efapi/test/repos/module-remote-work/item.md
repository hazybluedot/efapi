# Accessing Computing Resources

There are two parts to setting up your laptop to complete EF 105 work
remotely:

1. gaining access to MATLAB, 
2. gaining access to the files you have stored on your H-drive.

Options for both of these are described in the following sections.

# Securing Necessary Technology

If you do not have a laptop or internet connection that is suitable
for participating in online learning, use the [tech
request](https://forms.utk.edu/tech-request/) form to request the
