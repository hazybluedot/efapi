Create a new worksheet in your `lab03_practice` file named
'Fibonacci'. Complete the following problem in that worksheet.

Generate a Fibonacci Sequence for the values 0 to
63245986. The sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,… To do this we
will use the knowledge that \\( X_n= X_(n-1)+X_(n-2) \\). For example
13 = 8 + 5.

1. Type 0 into cell A1 and 1 into A2.
2. Use the formula in cell A3 to start the Fibonacci Sequence.
   Remember: formulas always start with an `= `sign.
3. Copy the formula from A3 down to A50 (select A3 and drag
   corner). 
   
::: aside Remember:
To view the formulas double click the cell or `ctrl + '` (apostrophe). 
	 
Mac users:The `ctrl + '`
(apostrophe) command works
only for Windows machines.

To show all the formulas  
select the Formulas Tab- “Show formulas” or ctrl + \`
(back-quote). Notice how the references changed.

4. Switch back to the number view hit ESC. This is good if you are
   editing an equation and make a mistake ESC will not save any
   changes where ENTER will.
5. Format column A to be numbers with 0 decimal places to get rid of
   the scientific notation.(Highlight column A, Format Cells, Number).
6. Note if the \#\#\#\# is displayed, this means the number is too
   large for the current cell width. Double click on the column
   divider between A and B to automatically fit the column width to
   the numbers.
7.  Save your file
