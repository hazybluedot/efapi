- MATLAB's syntax to iterate over a list of filenames is obtuse. The problem is with the engineers at Mathworks, not with you.
- Other than the funky syntax, the for-loop works the same way: the body of the loop is executed exactly once for eace item in the list. Each time through the looping variable, in this case 'file', takes on the current value from the list.
