Practice what you learned today and try creating a new program that 

1. accepts a user input vector entered as an angle <code>theta</code> in degrees and magnitude <code>distance</code> in feet from the user.
2. calculates `x` and `y` components for this vector
3. Prints an output message indicating the x and y components

<samp>
Enter an angle in degrees: <kbd>20&#9166;</kbd></br>
Enter a distance in feet: <kbd>10&#9166;</kbd></br>
The x component is 9.4 and the y component is 3.4
</samp>

## Alternate Output

Modify the above program so that it matches the following sample interaction:

<samp>
Enter an angle in degrees: <kbd>20&#9166;</kbd><br/>
Enter a distance in feet: <kbd>10&#9166;</kbd><br/>
The coordinates are [9.4, 3.4]
</samp>

## Reflect and Re-Read

To practice thinking about some of the more abstract concepts which
will help in the long run, go back through the examples and programs
you worked on today and try to identify parts that are *expressions*
and *statements*.
