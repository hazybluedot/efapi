<!-- NOTE:
I had intended to redo the screenshots in this section to use charts without connected data points but did not have time. Let students know that generally when plotting discrete data it is not appropriate to connect the data points with a smooth line. When plotting functions, which they will do in the practice section, it is appropriate to plot a connected line.

Students have seen the creation of charts several times now, so while it is still good to verbalize your steps, "Now I am going to insert a chart by selecting the data, then clicking 'Insert', etc." you can speed that part up a little bit and spend more time verbalizing the new  features such as formating axis and lines.
--> 

1.  Open a blank file in Excel and save the file in your H drive. Don't
    forget to include Lab 5 and your NetID in the file name.
2.  Copy/paste the time/velocity data(including labels) into the first
    worksheet. Use "paste special" to paste the values without the formatting.

## Create a Velocity vs. Time Plot

1. Highlight the data, select "Insert", "Chart", "Scatter" {.detaillevel .detaillevel-2}

2.  Remove title and legend.

    - Click each element, then press `Delete` {.detaillevel .detaillevel-2}
	
3.  Add axis titles, and vertical/horizontal major grid-lines.

	- (Chart tools, Design, Add Chart Element, etc) {.detaillevel .detaillevel-2}
	
	- (Mac Users: Chart Design, Add Chart Element, etc) {.detaillevel .detaillevel-2 .os .os-mac}
		
4.  Move x axis labels to bottom 

    - Right click on x values, Format Axis, Axis Options, change axis
    labels to "LOW" {.detaillevel .detaillevel-2}
	
5.  Make x axis heavier, make y axis heavier.

	- Right click on axis, Format Axis, Line Style) {.detaillevel .detaillevel-2}

6.  (optional) Make curve thicker, change color (Right click on curve,
    Format Data Series)
	
7.  Your plot should look something like this:\
    ![](pix/velocity_chart.png){.screencap}
