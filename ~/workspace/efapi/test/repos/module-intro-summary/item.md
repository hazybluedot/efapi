- Keep up with assignments, the expectation is that you have work for
  one lab complete before starting the next, even if the due-date
  suggests otherwise.
- Talk to each other. Explaining tricky concepts to someone else is a
  good way to identify parts that are still confusing to you. Maybe
  the person you are explaining to can help your understanding, and if
  they are confused about the same points this process helps to
  identify questions you can pose to an instructor.
- Practice the material. Most of the skills we will practice in this
  class are more easily demonstrated than described. For the most
  part, if you practice them regularly you will develop muscle-memory
  that will make recalling relatively complex sequences of actions with ease.
- Reflect on where you are struggling. One common challenge is
  managing new math concepts with new computer skills at the same
  time. If this seems to be the problem, practice the math concepts in
  isolation (refer to EF151 content as necessary) to master them
  first, then try to use them with new computer skills.
