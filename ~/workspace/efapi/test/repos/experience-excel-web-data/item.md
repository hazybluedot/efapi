Create a new worksheet and name it "Web". We will practice importing
data from the web into this sheet.

``` facilitator-guide
I am considering dropping this section and folding the bit about copying and pasting from a web page into the 'copy and paste' section above. Importing from the web this way is not used on the quiz, is it used in 151? I think a more useful section would be on the import of .csv files, but that may come later.
```

## Copy and Paste

-   Go to: [Counts of Geographic Types in North
    Carolina](lab3_NC_data.htm){target="_blank"} and
    select all the data (Ctrl + A) and copy it (Ctrl + C)
-   Highlight cell A1 in your Web tab and paste (Ctrl + V). Notice if
    you paste it keeps all of the formatting. Undo (Ctrl + Z) and right
    click in cell A1 and select the second clip board. When you mouse
    over it should say “match destination formatting”. Depending on the
    way the copied data is formatted, when it is pasted into Excel it
    will automatically be arranged properly into rows and columns, but
    sometimes additional formatting is necessary.
    
    Mac users: After undoing the first paste, select cell A1 so it is the
    active cell. Along the Home ribbon, click the down arrow next to the
    Paste button. Then select Match Destination Formatting. {.os .os-mac}
-   Format the columns so that you can see all of the text without it
    being cut off.
	
## Importing From a URL

-   You can also "import" data using the web address. In a different
    worksheet try: Data -> Get external data -> From Web.
-   Copy/paste the URL (then 'go').
-   Select the arrow of the table you want to import, then 'import'.
-   Choose 'ok' to put data in existing worksheet.
