-   Over 75% of the EF students for the past 4 years have had TI-83+ or
    84+ calculators. This is because many high schools require/provide
    this calculator and use it in their curriculum. Thus, we'll focus on
    the TI-83+ and TI-84+, but we don't require this calculator.
-   Whatever calculator you have, you should learn to use it for more
    than just basic operations. For the purposes of this lab, you may
    access a TI-83+ simulator if you don't have immediate access to the
    real thing: [virtual calculator]({{wwwroot}}/vti.exe); click
    "save" then "run."
-   Once you've started the emulator, it is a good idea to right click
    and select Reset Calculator to clear anything that might have been
    left by a previous user.

## TI Documentation

The owners manual for your specific calculator is an invaluable
resource to learn how to execute specific tasks.

-   **TI Documentation:** The documentation for your specific
    calculator model is a good reference source, whether you're trying
    to find a faster way to do something or find out what all those
    buttons do.

## Download your Manual

Download the manual for your calculator:
- [TI-83+ manual](ti83p-guide.pdf) <!-- {target="_blank"} -->
- [TI-84+ manual](TI84Plus_guidebook_EN.pdf) <!-- {target="_blank"} -->
- [TI-Nspire CX/Casmanual.](TI-Nspire_CX-HH_GettingStarted_EN.pdf) <!-- {target="_blank"} -->

If you have a different TI calculator, try to find the manual on the [TI website](https://education.ti.com/en/guidebook/search) <!-- {target="_blank"} -->

## Organize your Reference Documentation

Over the course of the next few years, you will collect usage guides,
data-sheets, and instruction manuals for various tools. It is useful to
organize these on your file system so that you know where to find
reference material when you need it.

- Create a new folder on your H-drive named "reference"
- Move your downloaded calculator manual into this new folder.
