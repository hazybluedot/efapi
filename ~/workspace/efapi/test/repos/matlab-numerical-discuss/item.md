At this point you should have two figures:

1. Figure 1 visualizes acceleration, velocity, and position as calculated from acceleration measurements.
2. Figure 2 visualizes position, velocity, and acceleration as calculated from position measurements.

The two plots will not look the same, but they are showing calculations from the same set of data.

1. Identify and discuss differences between the two velocity
   calculations. Do you think one or the other has more accurate
   velocity information? Which would you trust more?
2. How do the differences in the two calculated velocities relate to
   the measurements of acceleration and position? How many times per
   second is there a new position measurement from GPS? How many times
   per second is there a new acceleration measurement from the
   accelerometers?
