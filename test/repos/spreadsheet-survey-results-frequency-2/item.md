Ask students to repeate the analysis steps you demonstrated for question 1 for the question 2 data. Encourage them to talk to one another as they are working to help each other out. Encourage them to experiment, try moving formulas around, try putting in absolute references where relative are called for, etc.
```

Try to repeat the steps used to get frequencies and percentages of
response values for question 1 but for question 2 values. Remember,
when applying the `FREQUENCY` function:

1. Select the range of 5 cells you wish the result array to go to.
2. After typing in the formula, press `Ctrl + Shift + Enter` instead of just `Enter`.

Your final spreadsheet may look something like this:

Note: You do **not** need to have results done for Question 1. Graders
will only be looking for Question 2 results.

As you are working through the steps, be sure to take a few
opportunities to try to deviate from the instructions to see what
happens. For example, try using `$` in a formula that does not call
for one. Does it still work the way you want? Discuss with your
neighbors when variations work or do not work to understand what is
going on.

Note: If you finish quickly and you hadn't been following along for
question 1, try to copy and paste your formulas for question 2 for
question 1 to get those results. What about the formulas has to change
for it to work? What can stay the same?
