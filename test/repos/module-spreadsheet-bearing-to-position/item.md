All this work has made Lazy Dog anxious. He decides to take a relaxing
walk from Estabrook[^estabrook] to Perkins Hall. To impress his professors, Lazy
Dog decides to put vector addition into practice and create a plot of
his route. He takes a compass and a notepad/pencil to record his
paces. He also takes a stopwatch to see how long the trip takes him.\
Being a lazy dog, he does not want to calculate all of this by hand,
but he hasn't had EF105 and doesn't know how to use Excel.

[^estabrook]: Estabrook is a building that [no longer
    exists](https://www.knoxnews.com/story/shopper-news/bearden/2018/06/20/ut-buildings-estabrook-hall-berry-hall-and-pasqua-hall-razed/704551002/){target="_blank"}
    and was the previous home of the [Engineering Fundamentals
    Program](https://engage.utk.edu/).
