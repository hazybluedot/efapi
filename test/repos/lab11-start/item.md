# Getting Started

Make sure to review the material in the [pre-lab]({{wwwroot}}/modules/matlab-model-fit/prelab.php), there is a demo of working through the same type of activity you will be doing for this lab.

We will be using the same data file `cart_data_incline.csv` that we
used in Labs 9 and 10.

1. Create a new script named `lab11_{{netid}}.m` in your `EF105\Lab11` folder.

# Review of Skills Required

Completing this lab will require that you put together several things we have learned so far:

1. Loading data from a file
2. Using array indexing to extract rows and columns of data
3. Displaying formatted output using `fprintf`
3. Plotting data
   - Multiple data series on the same plot
   - Controling the plot style (discrete points vs. connected line)
4. Fitting data to a polynomial model
5. Evaluating a polynomial model on a set of x values.   
5. Initializing a vector.

It is easy to look at that long list and become overwhelmed. Just take
it one step at a time and refer back to your previous to find exampls
of each part and think about how to adapt them for this lab.
