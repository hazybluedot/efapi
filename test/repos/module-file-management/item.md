It will become increasingly important to practice good file
organization skills as you work with an increasing number of files and
software packages this semester. It will also be very important to
keep track of files have your most up-to-date work in them so that you
can submit the correct one for homeworks and exams. Adopting a
meaningful and consistent file structure and naming convention for all
your files will help when you want to refer back to a particular file,
and make it easier to find the correct file when uploading to the
dropbox.

# Outcomes

::: aside Terminology
You may hear some folks use the words "directory" and "sub-directory" instead of "folder". For our purposes, these all mean the same thing, though there are some [important, but often subtle, distinctions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5078676/what-is-the-difference-between-a-directory-and-a-folder#5078792) that may become relevant once we start writing programs that need to access files from the file system.
:::

After completing this module you will gain experience

- creating and organizing folders on a file system
- downloading files, moving and renaming them
- extracting a zip archive to a desired folder.

# Locate Folders in File Manager

- Locate the Downloads folder
- Locate the H-drive
- Practice how to select/view each one, and to identify which you are viewing

# Create a Folder Structure

- In your H-drive, create a folder named <code>EF105</code>
</section>

# Downloading Files from the Web

- Download this [Zip Archive](Lab01.zip). Zip archives can contain multiple files and folders bundled as one file.
- Locate the downloaded file in your "Downloads" folder.
- Move the downloaded file to your <code>EF105</code> folder on your H-drive.
- Extract the contents of the zip archive to your <code>EF105</code> folder. This will create a new sub-folder named "Lab01" containing two files.
- Delete the zip archive, it is no longer needed.

# Finding Files

## Windows

In the file manager there will always be a search input at the top of the file list, to the right of the path.

1. Type in a word or part of a file name.
2. The search results will update if you stop typing for a few moments
3. Double-clicking a search result will bring you to the corresponding
   location in the file manager

# Checking File Meta-data

Files generally store data associated with a particular purpose defined by the user. For example, Excel files store data that represents numbers and calculations in a spreadsheet. The operating system stores its own data *about* each file. This is called "meta-data". The details of what meta-data are stored for files varies a bit with operating systems, but you can expect to find the information about a file

- a creation date and time
- a last modified data and time
- a size in bytes (1 byte is used to store a single character, like <code>a</code>).

Viewing this information can be helpful when you are searching for a
particular file and several of the same name in different folders
exist. For example, if you recently saved a file that you intend to
upload for a dropbox submission, but when you go to find the file it
has a last modified date of more than a few moments ago, it is
probably not the one you just saved!
