Estimate velocity data for the cart data two different ways:

1. By numerically differentiating position data
2. By numerically integrating acceleration data

## Getting Started

1. Create a new worksheet and name it "Velocity Estimation"
2. Copy the "Time", "Position", and "Acceleration" columns from the
   "cart_incline" worksheet and past them into your new "Velocity
   Estimation" worksheet. 
   - The label "Time (s)" should be in cell A1 with all other data
     following in the original order, so "Position (b)" should be B2,
     etc.
