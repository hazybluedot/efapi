[](pix/screen-elements.png) Microsoft Excel is a
[spreadsheet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet) program. It is
part of the Microsoft Office suite of programs (Word, Powerpoint, Excel,
Access, Outlook) that have become a de facto standard for industry use.
Because of the University's enterprise agreement with Microsoft,
students are able to download and install Microsoft Office ProPlus
desktop applications **AT NO ADDITIONAL COST**. Any student whose
primary affiliation is "student" is eligible for this program. Other
classes will use MS Office as well, so you might as well go ahead and
get it now.

Spreadsheets are very powerful tools for organizing and working with
tables of information (numbers, dates, words, etc). We will
demonstrate and learn the use of spreadsheets, using Excel as an
example. If you want more tutorials, there are several excellent web
sites referenced at the end of this lab.

## Dual Purpose Tool

Spreadsheet software is used for two distinct jobs:
1. Data analysis: this involves loading data, inspecting it, and performing calculations on it to understand what information it contains.
2. Data presentation and communication: once relevant information is discovered through analysis, you may also choose to use the spreadsheet software to generate some kind of report to communicate your findings.

This lab will include information about spreadsheet features used for both purposes. For the time being, focus on the data analysis features and just note the presentation features for later.

<!-- NOTES:
Main takeaway: while we will be using Excel as a tool, these skills will transfer to other spreadsheet software such as LibreOffice Calc, Google Sheets.

## Excel: Windows vs Mac

In general terms, versions of Excel for Windows and Mac are reasonably
compatible; however, some tasks will require a different sequence of
instructions to complete them. 

## Other Spreadsheet Software

There are spreadsheet programs other than Excel, and they all work in
very similar ways.

-   [LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/) is
    part of the LibreOffice suite of programs which offers a free
    alternative to Microsoft Office. LibreOffice programs will run on
    Windows, Mac, and Linux and are free to install and use by everyone.
-   [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) is a
    cloud-based spreadsheet program created by Google. Because it runs
    in your web browser it will work across Windows, Mac, and Linux.
    Because it runs in the cloud, data are easily accessed from
    different computers, and shared with multiple users. While it does
    not cost any money to use, like other Google products you pay by
    allowing Google to use your personal data for its business purposes.
