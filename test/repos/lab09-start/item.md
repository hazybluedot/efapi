# Announcements

- Details about how the switch to all-online will affect EF 105 will be shared as an announcement as the plan develops.
- [Final Exam Schedule]({{wwwroot}}/control/final-exam-schedule.php) is Posted
  - While there is a possibility we may have not returned to campus
    for final exams, we are currently planning as if we will return to
    campus after April 3.
  - You may switch to any available section up until the first day of exams.
  - Need three volunteers from the 11:10 sections to switch exam times to another time slot.

# Getting Started

## The Data

Download
[cart_incline_energy.csv]({{wwwroot}}/data/cart_incline_energy.csv)
and save it to your `EF105/data` folder on your H-drive.

## The Script

- Create a new folder, if you haven't already, named <kbd>Lab09</kbd> in your `EF105` folder.
- In MATLAB, navigate the current folder to `EF105/Lab09`
- Create a new script file named `lab09_{{netid}}.m`
  - Put a doc comment on the first line of the script that will eventually contain a description of what the program does. Be sure to complete it once you are done with the program and have a good idea of what it does!
  - After the doc comment, put the `clear` command so that your script
    starts with a clean workspace.
  - You may also find it helpful to put the `clc` command at the top
    to clear your command window. This can sometimes make it easier to
    observe what command window output is coming directly from running
    a script.
