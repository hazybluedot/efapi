As our programs become more complex, it also becomes more important to
maintain good organization. This program also can be grouped into the
Read, Execute, Print pattern discussed earlier.

Discuss the following considerations with a neighbor:
1. How should code associated with checking user inputs be organized?
2. How should code associated with plotting be organized?

Review each other's programs and make suggestions for reorganization. 

Next lab we will begin working with techniques to iterate over parts
of code multiple times using loops. It will be important to have a
clear distinction between what belongs in 'execute' and what belongs
in 'print' to understand how programs with loops behave.
