-   Before portable calculators, engineers used slide rules. Slide
    rules used logarithmic scales to allow you to multiply, divide,
    exponentiate, solve trig problems, etc. You had to set up the
    problem carefully, keep track of the decimal place, and do
    addition and subtraction on paper. So your first task is a little
    lesson in history and calculator appreciation.
-   **Task:** Use this [virtual slide rule](sliderule/virtual-slide-rule.html) to do a [few exercises](/ef105/slide_rule_fun.pdf).
-   Think you're ready for the hard stuff? Try using the slide rule to
    show that 36\*sin(33) = 19.6

-   Portable electronic calculators started appearing in the 1970's. If
    you are interested in the evolution of the calculator, here is a
    neat site: [The Old Calculator
    Museum](http://www.oldcalculatormuseum.com/index.html). Now you
    should really appreciate your calculator!
