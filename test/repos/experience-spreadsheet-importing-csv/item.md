Follow along with this example, the file you create will eventually be submitted for grading.

::: aside Preserve the Original 
When importing data into spreadsheet
software from other sources, always keep a copy of the original in a
safe location and be careful not to save over it. Spreadsheet
software, such as Excel, has a tendency to silently modify data you open in it without telling you. For instance, if you load a CSV file that contains numbers in decimal format, in some cases Excel will silently convert these to scientific notation, if you then save the file back to the same location you could potentially overwrite important information!

## Import Data into Excel

1. Open Excel and select `File` -> `Open`. Browse for the `us_states_metrics.csv` file you saved and click `Open`
3. If a Text Import Wizard box pops up:
   1. On Step 1, check the box indicting "My data has headers", hit `Next >`
   2. On Step 2, check the box `Comma` under delimiters and uncheck all others
   3. On Step 3, you don't need to change anything, click `Finish`
4. You should now have a new Excel worksheet named `us_state_metrics` with 6 columns of data.
5. Rename this worksheet to <kbd>US State Metrics</kbd>
5. On the ribbon, select `File` and `Save As`. Browse to a folder where you are saving assignment files for class, such as no your H drive.
6. Name the file `lab03_[netid]`, replacing `[netid]` with your Netid.
7. Under "Save as type", select "Excel Workbook"
8. Click "Save"

We will add to this file over several more practice problems before submitting as part of the graded material for this lab.

<!-- NOTES:
This is the section in which students are creating the `lab02_practice` file that they will submit as a graded assignment. Demo it yourself, and then treat it as a practice for students. Encourage those who finish quickly to help their neighbors!
