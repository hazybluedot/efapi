One of MATLAB's strengths is that it handles matrics very well
(remember, it's a MATrix LABoratory, after all!) A matrix is a way of collecting numbers together into rows and columns. For example,

$$A = \begin{matrix}
	5 & 3 & 7\\
	2 & 1 &0
\end{matrix}$$

We say that $A$ is a $2\times3$ matrix because it has 2 rows of
numbers and 3 columns. Matrices are an important tool in engineering
as they can be used to represent a wide variety of engineering systems.
