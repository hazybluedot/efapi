So far we have been working with data in tables (or cells in a
spreadsheet). Analysis has been conducted numerically and presenting
these numbers (sums, means, frequencies, etc.) in table form. This is
a useful communication format for small data sets, or single analysis
results, or when it is important that viewer see exact values for each
data point.

It is often useful to create visual representations of data. A visual
representation can help communicate features of the data or analysis
that would be difficult to see from a tabular representation:

- relationships between the magnitude of several pieces of data,
- trends or anomalies in sequential data, such as time-series data,
- understanding position and location data, or 2-dimensional trajectories.

Today we will explore the use of scatter plots. Scatter plots show
data as dots with no lines connecting the dots. Scatter plots are
appropriate for most experimental data such as:

- time series data (e.g. distance vs. time)
- 2-dimensional data such as position data.
