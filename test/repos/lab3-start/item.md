## Using this Content

In this and subsequent labs there will be a mix of informative
content, examples, and practice problems. In general:

- Example content will be demonstrated by your instructor. You are not
  expected to copy the same steps, but rather use this time to ask
  questions.
- Practice content is left for you to work through. Generally the
  practice content will require the same skills that were demonstrated
  in the Examples.

## Create Folders

Create two new folders in your `EF105` folder on your H drive:
- a folder named <kbd>data</kbd>. We will collect various data files
  used in class here. We are creating this folder under `EF105` and
  not under a specific lab because in many cases the data we use will
  be relevant to any lab.
- a folder named <kbd>Lab03</kbd>. We will store files specific to this lab here.

## Download and Save a Data File

1. Download [this CSV file](us_states_metrics.csv) to your `Downloads`
   folder.
2. Move `us_states_metrics.csv` from the `Downloads` folder to the
   `EF105/data` folder on your H drive.
3. When working with data it is important to keep an original copy to avoid accidentally overwriting data:
   1. Right click on the `us_states_metrics.csv` file
   2. Select 'properties' from the menu
   3. Check the 'Read-only' box
   4. Click 'OK'
   
   ![screenshot of file Properties for us_states_metrics.csv](pix/data_file_properties_read-only.png)
   
   This will prevent excel or other software from overwriting this file. When we get ready to work with it we will import it into an Excel worksheet and save the workbook in the `Lab03` folder.
