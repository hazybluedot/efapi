One of the advantages of working with spreadsheet software on a
computer is that we can easily analysis large amounts of data. We've
seen how we can enter data manually into a spreadsheet, but that would
get tedious for large amounts of data.

A popular and simple file format used to share data is a "comma
delimited values" file, or CSV file. As the name suggests, data in
this format has values that are *delimited*, or separated, by
commas. A simple CSV file might contain the following data:

``` csv
Month, Number of Birthdays
Jan,   11
Feb,   14
Mar,   13
Apr,   10
May,   13
Jun,   15
Jul,   14
Aug,   14
Sep,   14
Oct,   15
Nov,   11
Dec,   8
```

As you can see, the comma (`,`) separates the values in each *record*
with a separate record on each line. Any data that can be represented
as a flat table with a consistent number of columns and rows can be
easily stored as a CSV file.
