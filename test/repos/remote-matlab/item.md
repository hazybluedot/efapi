There are three ways you can access MATLAB on your own computer, you only need to pick one:

- [UTK Citrix Server](https://apps.utk.edu)
  - No extra setup required
    - Mac Users: Use [Citrix Workspace](
https://www.citrix.com/downloads/workspace-app/mac/workspace-app-for-mac-latest.html) instead of Citrix Receiver. Once installed the instructions are exactly the same.
  - Easy access to H-drive from within MATLAB
  - You will have to [set-up access to your H-drive](https://help.utk.edu/kb/index.php?func=show&e=1602) on your computer to submit your work
  - @[video]({{wwwroot}}/vid/AccessMATLAB_Citrix)
- [MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online.html)
  - Use this method if you are unable to install MATLAB on your
    laptop, or are unable to map your H-drive to your laptop.
  - Requires registering for a Mathworks account
  - Use of [MATLAB drive](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-drive.html) cloud storage
  - You will have to setup access to MATLAB drive on your computer to submit your work
  - If you do want to continue accessing your H-drive, that is an [additional step](https://help.utk.edu/kb/index.php?func=show&e=1602).
- Local Install
  - Requires installing MATLAB on your own computer
    - Follow instructions provided by [UTK Software Distribution](https://webapps.utk.edu/oit/softwaredistribution/)
  - Usually the best performance, depending on your hardware
  - Accessing H-drive is an [additional step](https://help.utk.edu/kb/index.php?func=show&e=1602).
  - Does not require a continuous internet connection. This may give you more flexibility in where you can get work done.

We will be available to help with the setup of any of these methods via Zoom, either through break-out rooms during the regular lab time, or by [scheduling a Zoom meeting with Dr. Maczka]({{wwwroot}}/faculty/dmaczka.php). <!-- {p:.alert .alert-info} -->
