# Your H-Drive

Files stored on your H-drive can be accessed once you [map your
H-drive](https://help.utk.edu/kb/index.php?func=show&e=1602) to your
computer. If you are off-campus you will also need to [set up a VPN
connection](https://help.utk.edu/kb/index.php?func=show&e=2712).

# MATLAB Drive

If you choose to use MATLAB Online, you will have to access files
stored on MATLAB drive to submit your work. You can access files
stored on the MATLAB drive via the [web interface](https://drive.matlab.com/files/), or by installing the
[MATLAB drive connector](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-drive.html?s_tid=MLD_MWprod#matlab-drive-connector).

# Local Storage

If you are runing MATLAB directly from your computer, and you have not
been able to map your H-drive, you will be storing files locally. We
recommend that you adopt a similar file structure that we have been
using on our H-drive: create an EF105 folder with sub-folders for each
lab.

We will be available to help with the setup of any of these methods via Zoom, either through break-out rooms during the regular lab time, or by [scheduling a Zoom meeting with Dr. Maczka]({{wwwroot}}/faculty/dmaczka.php). <!-- {p:.alert .alert-info} -->
