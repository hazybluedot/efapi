## Welcome to MATLAB!
We will be using MATLAB for the remainder of the semester. You have
two options for running MATLAB:
- Run remotely from the [UTK citrix server](https://apps.utk.edu/vpn/index.html)
  - This will require a one-time download and install of the Citrix Receiver if you have not already done so.
  - If you are unable to access MATLAB or other Apps via Citrix, please contact <a href="https://oit.utk.edu/">OIT</a>. If after contacting OIT please let us know if there is anything we can do to help you get MATLAB working on your UTK account or personal laptop.
	- Download and install on your own computer for free from the [OIT software distribution page](https://webapps.utk.edu/oit/softwaredistribution/).

	If you are required to take EF230, you will need to have
	MATLAB installed on your personal computer for that class, so
	you may want to go ahead with that option starting now.

## Additional Help Session Hours

Beginning *Tuesday, March 10*, there will be an additional help
session on Tuesdays in Perkins 209 from 4-6pm.
