1. Take a few minutes to read through each line of the start file and
   make sure you understand what each line is doing. Try to identify
   the line or lines of code corresponding to each of the calculation
   steps described above.
1. Make note of any differences between how we typically represent the
   equation in mathematics vs. how the calculation is performed in
   MATLAB. Recognizing these differences will make it easier to encode
   your own math equations as MATLAB calculations.
2. Comment each line to explain what it is doing *in the context of the problem*.
   - Discuss with a neighbor and reach a consensus for each comment.
