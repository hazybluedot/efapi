Why should you care about learning to program? 

### Situations you may need to code

- there may not be pre-existing software that does everything you need to solve a particular problem
- you may need to implement an algorithm on a platform with limited computing resources (e.g. Arduino, Raspberry Pi)

### Non-coding situations

Even if you never have to write a line of code in your life after this class, there are other benefits to having a working understanding of programming concepts:

- communicating with other people who are writing code for your project
- practicing systematic and logical thinking.

## A Different Context for Familiar Ideas

Programming is often perceived as something very foreign by folks who
have not had much experience with it. While it is true that it *does*
require a different way of thinking from many other problems, and
there *are* some very real challenges, there are also important ways
that programming is similar to concepts and skills you are already
familiar with.

### Syntax

A very common challenge when learning programming is working through syntax rules, e.g.:
- When is a semicolon needed? 
- When are parenthesis (<code>( )</code>) needed? 
- Square brackets (<code>[ ]</code>)?
- etc.

This can be tricky to remember, but I'm sure you are capable of
learning, and so should you. Why am I so sure? Because you already
follow a set of syntax rules when you write in English, or any other
written human language. The use of punctuation in written languages
follows a certain set of rules, some usages are "correct". If you are
like me, you probably still make some mistakes from time-to-time, and
have to go back and correct them. That is perfectly normal, and
expected!

So what is different about syntax in programming? The main difference
is that the rules are much more strict writing a program than when
writing for a human. Consider the two sentences:

```
1. Did you see the latest Avengers movie?
2. Did you see the latest Avengers movie.
```

The first is grammatically correct and consistent. The words form a
question, which is ended with a question mark. The second sentence is
not consistent in some way, the words suggest a question, but the use
of a period instead of a question mark suggests it is a
statement. Often human readers will be able to understand the intended
meaning from surrounding context. Computers are not very good at
understanding context (yet), which is one reason the grammar and
syntax rules for programming are much more strict: there cannot be any
ambiguity in what actions a program describes!

Another situation you can find yourself in is two syntactically
correct formulations that mean different things. Consider the
following sentences:

```
1. Let's eat, Grandma!
2. Let's eat Grandma!
```

Both are correct, both make logical sense. A computer would happily
carry out either to exacting detail. In the case of the second
sentence, that is probably not what you, or your grandma, want! Again,
humans benefit from a lot of contextual knowledge to recognize that
there is probably an error. We generally understand that "grandma" is
not something that is eaten, but computers do not have this type of
contextual understanding unless the programmer provides it.

### Audience

We have seen some similarities between writing a computer program, and
writing an essay or project report. There is one final similarly that
is important because it helps explain one reason why writing a
computer program and be more difficult than writing an essay. In both
forms of writing, you must take into account the *audience*, that is,
who is expected to read or comprehend the piece of writing?

- When writing notes for class, the audience is usually yourself
- When writing a lab or project report for class, the audience is usually your professor
- When writing a text to a friend, the audience is your friend

Think about how you change your writing style and structure depending
on the audience you are writing for.

#### The Three Audiences of a Computer Program

- The computer: the audience with the most strict rules, but not
  necessarily the hardest to program for, but it will feel like the
  most difficult to program for in the beginning!
- The programmer(s): could be more than 1!
- The user: sometimes the same as the programmer, but not always,
  e.g. you (probably) did not program Excel, but you use it. This is
  often the most difficult audience to account for when developing a
  program that will be used by someone other than yourself.

Trying to write for three audiences at the same time is very
difficult. While that is the end goal, as you get started it is ok to
just focus on a single audience: the computer.
