1. In your `lab03_[netid]` workbook file, go to the worksheet named "US States Metrics". 
2. Freeze the column titles for the data. Refer to the "Formatting Cells in Excel" tab of the [Working With Excel]({{wwwroot}}/gen/spreadsheet-reference.php)
3. In the row below where you calculate the SUM of the state populations, calculate the average state population. 
3. Copy the SUM and AVERAGE formulas across the rest of the columns to
   obtain totals and average values for total area, water area, and
   congressional districts.
   - Name the cell containing the value for the total area <kbd>area_total</kbd>
   - Name the cell containing the value for average water area <kbd>water_average</kbd>
   
   See the Manipulating and Naming Cells section of the [Working With Excel]({{wwwroot}}/gen/spreadsheet-reference.php) to learn how to assign descriptive names to cells.
   
3. What is the most populated state? 

    ::: collapse Hint 
    - Try an internet search to discover the spreadsheet function that
    will return the maximum value in a range of cells.
    - Alternatively, try sorting the data by population. Make sure to sort all the columns, not just the population column!
