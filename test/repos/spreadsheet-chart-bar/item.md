Create a simple bar chart summarizing your class's birthdays by month.

1.  Highlight only the important data, Excel tries to guess the column
    titles and often guess right, so select from A2 to B14.
2.  Go to the "Insert" tab. Under the Charts section, select column and pick
    the first 2D (called “Clustered Column” for Macs). Voila!
3.  Notice when the Chart is selected 2 new tabs appear at the top
    (Design & Format)(Chart Design and Format for Macs).
4.  Once a chart is created you can change the type by clicking the
    Design tab, then Change Chart Type. Select "Bar" (Bar &gt; Clustered
    Bar for Macs). If the months appear backwards, double click on the
    months and in the Axis Options, find "Categories in reverse order."
    Put a check in the box, then close.
5.  Also notice that Excel tried to title the chart and label the data
    series. The series name is correct but the title is wrong. You can
    edit the title by doing a slow double click on the text. Put
    "Student's Birthdays" as title
6.  **IMPORTANT:** use the "Add Chart Element" inside the Design tab to
    add axis titles, axis labels, legend, gridlines etc.
7.  Identify the chart area, plot area, source data, legend, axis,
    title, gridlines, etc.
8.  Any one of these areas can be edited by right clicking it. Notice
    that different options appear depending on where you click!
9.  Try right clicking on a blank chart area, and use "Move Chart" to
    place it into a different worksheet. Now move it back to the
    worksheet named "EXAMPLE 1".
