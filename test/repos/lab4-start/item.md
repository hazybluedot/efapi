# Getting Started

## Data
- Download [this zip archive]({{wwwroot}}/data/cart_data.zip) containing
several data files,
- extract the contents to your `EF105/data` folder on your H drive.
- Mark each file as 'Read-only'.

## Lab 4 Start File

Download the [lab04_start.xlsx](lab04_start.xlsx) file and save it as `lab04_[netid].xlsx`
in your `EF105/Lab04` folder on your H drive, replacing `[netid]` with
your own NetID.

You will work through the practice problems in this file. There are
initially two worksheets in the start file and you will add a third as
part of this lab. Once you have completed the lab, submit the
completed workbook to your dropbox.
